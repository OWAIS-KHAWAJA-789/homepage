# Custom Browser Homepage

This is a simple, customizable browser homepage that I use with Brave. It includes essential features like a clock, a Google search bar, quick links to commonly used websites, and a to-do list that stores tasks in the browser's local storage. It's designed for minimal distractions and easy access to everything I need right on my homepage.

## Features

- **Clock**: Displays the current time, updating every second.
- **Search Bar**: Directly search Google from the homepage.
- **Quick Links**: Easy access to sites like GitHub, Gmail, Wikipedia, ChatGPT, Google Classroom, and Reddit.
- **To-Do List**: A simple to-do list that stores tasks in local storage, so your tasks persist across sessions.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or copy the HTML code into a new `.html` file.
2. Open the file in your browser.
3. Customize it by adding/removing links or modifying the to-do list functionality.
4. Enjoy a clean, efficient, and customizable homepage!

## How to Add Tasks
- Type a task in the input field and click the "Add" button.
- Tasks are stored in local storage and will persist even after refreshing the page.
- Edit tasks by changing the text, and remove them by clicking the "X" button next to each task.

## Technologies Used

That's it! Simple, functional, and easy to tweak.
